# ekidona-magazines-da098b
Script part of the addon "Ekidona magazines"
The complete version of the addon (with configurations and other content) can be found on the original ModDB page: https://www.moddb.com/mods/dead-air/addons/ekidona-magazines
If you find errors/bugs in the modification functionality, you can use the "issues" tab, but with a number of conditions:
1: NO reports that you found an error when trying to connect different addons (you can read about adaptations on the ModDB page and in the "ReadMe" of the addon itself).
2: NO reports of actual errors in the game, incorrect configurations, etc. - it's best to report this personally to me (because I'm responsible for the addon in this form).
If you find a bug caused by incorrect LUA script playback, or it's "unexplained" crashes - don't be afraid to report it, but please note, you will do better if you test the addon on the original.

Additionally, I copy the link to the archive for this project: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m6ePEjyl-5qVZ2O009ZsKzrsQF7tZ67z?usp=share_link
